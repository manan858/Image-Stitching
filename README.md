# Image-Stitching
Implementation of image stitching and panorama construction using Python and OpenCV.

* To construct image panorama, computer vision and image processing techniques are utilized such as: keypoint detection and local invariant descriptors; keypoint matching; RANSAC; and perspective warping.
* Since there are major differences in how OpenCV 2.4.X and OpenCV 3.X handle keypoint detection and local invariant descriptors (such as SIFT and SURF), Iâ€™ve taken special care to provide code that is compatible with both versions (provided that you compiled OpenCV 3 with opencv_contrib  support, of course).

## Image stitching algorithm
* **Step #1:** Detect keypoints (DoG, Harris, etc.) and extract local invariant descriptors (SIFT, SURF, etc.) from the two input images.
* **Step #2:** Match the descriptors between the two images.
* **Step #3:** Use the RANSAC algorithm to estimate a homography matrix using our matched feature vectors.
* **Step #4:** Apply a warping transformation using the homography matrix obtained from Step #3.
 
### Usage
* python stitch.py --first images/FIRST_IMAGE.png --second images/SECOND_IMAGE.png
